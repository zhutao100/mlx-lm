## Code Quality Observations

This is a markdown file, not a code file. It is well-written and provides clear and comprehensive documentation for the server. The inclusion of `curl` examples is helpful for users who want to test the server from the command line.

## Potential Issues Flagged for the Final Report

- The note about the server not being recommended for production is important and well-placed.
- The documentation for the request and response fields is detailed and easy to understand.
- The file could benefit from a section on how to handle errors and what error codes to expect.
