# .pre-commit-config.yaml

## File Purpose and Responsibilities

Configures `pre-commit` hooks to keep formatting consistent across contributions.

## Key Hooks and Their Roles

- `black` (`psf/black-pre-commit-mirror`): enforces consistent Python formatting.
- `isort` (`pycqa/isort`, `--profile=black`): sorts imports compatibly with Black.

## Code Quality Observations

- Minimal, formatter-focused setup (fast feedback, low friction).
- Version-pinned hooks improve reproducibility across machines/CI.

## Potential Issues Flagged for the Final Report

- Optional: add basic hygiene hooks (e.g., trailing whitespace, EOF fixer) or linting (e.g., Ruff) if the project wants stricter automated checks.
