# .gitignore

## File Purpose and Responsibilities

Defines which generated/developer-local files Git should ignore (bytecode, virtualenvs, build artifacts, IDE config, and common tooling caches).

## Key Sections and Their Roles

- Python runtime artifacts: `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`
- Packaging/build outputs: `build/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`, etc.
- Test/tool caches: `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.coverage*`, etc.
- Environment/IDE: `.env`, `venv/`, `.idea/`, `.vscode/`
- macOS metadata: `.DS_Store`

## Code Quality Observations

- Looks like a standard Python `.gitignore` template plus `.DS_Store`, which is appropriate for this repo.
- The repo currently contains ignored artifacts like `.DS_Store` and `__pycache__/` in the working tree (not an issue for versioning, but can be cleaned locally).

## Potential Issues Flagged for the Final Report

- Consider whether pinning Python via a committed `.python-version` is desirable; it is currently ignored.
